Perhap the highest priority for humanity now is building a conversational open source and decentralized global computer platform for collective human and digital intelligence.
This github project is for a demonstration of concept.
Components could include Open WebUI for the front end, a language model adapted to act as an interface to databases in the middle, and a vector and graph database such as Neo4j in the back end (Open WebUI demo at https://youtu.be/iLVyEgxGbg4?si=nFMlxR4P4xCXIoXC).
The platform would have methods to authenticate the identities of users, and to allow users to share parts of conversations anonymously.
The language model would extract entities and relationships from parts of conversations that users select to merge into a shared vector and graph representation.
The platform would continuously fact check statements merged into the shared graph.
The platform would report which issues are discussed by the most people, the sentiment expressed on proposed solutions, and show how this sentiment changes over time.
After the demonstration of concept, the platform could be scaled to merge the knowledge and sentiment expressed in millions of simultaneous conversations with people around the world, becoming a form of global collective intelligence.
Commissions of $1,000 can be paid to people who help develop this demonstration of concept. Contact: jkintree@gmail.com
