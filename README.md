I am interested in a conversational interface to an open source, global distributed platform for collective human and digital intelligence. 
My first github project is for a demonstration of concept of a platform for collective intelligence.
Components could include Open WebUI for the front end, a language model adapted to act as an interface to databases in the middle, and a hybrid vector and graph database such as Neo4J in the back end.
